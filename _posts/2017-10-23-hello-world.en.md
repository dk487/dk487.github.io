I decided to start yet another blog. Will write about Linux, about layouting,
about static sites, about Jekyll and Github, and about everything else.

Of course, this site itself will be built with static generation.
Generally, right here I will play with all that ideas, about which
I plan to wrote here.

And a finishing touch: I plan to make this site multilingual.
